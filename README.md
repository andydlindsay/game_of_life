Part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Build the Game of Life and satisfy the following user stories:
- When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
- I can start and stop the board.
- I can set up the board.
- I can clear the board.
- When I press start, the game will play out.
- Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
